        How to calculate Indian GST manually<br>
        To calculate Indian GST at 18% rate is very easy: just multiple your GST exclusive amount by 0.18.<br>
        $10 is GST exclusive value<br>
        <br>
        $10 * 0.18 = $1.8 GST amount<br>
        <br>
        To get GST inclusive amount multiply GST exclusive value by 1.18<br>
        $10 is GST exclusive value<br>
        <br>
        $10 * 1.18 = $11.8 GST inclusive amount<br>
        <br>
        To get GST part of GST inclusive amount you need divide GST inclusive amount by 118 and multiply by 18<br>
        $236 is GST inclusive value<br>
        <br>
        ($236 / 118) * 18 = $36 GST value<br>
        <br>
        To get GST exclusive amount while knowing GST inclusive value you need to multiply GST inclusive price by 100
        ant then
        divide result by 118
        $236 is GST inclusive value<br>
        <br>
        $236*100=$23600<br>
        <br>
        $23600/ 118 = $200
